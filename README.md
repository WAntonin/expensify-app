# Expensify app

This an app to log expenses. I created this app to pratice  what i learned about:
* React 16
* Redux
* React-router
* Jest
* Sass
* Firebase

This knowledge comes mainly from the course [The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/) by Andrew Mead.
